### The Problem: Mindless Scrolling

In today's digital age, countless hours are spent on apps like Instagram and TikTok engaging in mindless scrolling. While these platforms offer entertainment, they often leave users feeling unproductive and mentally drained. Our team identified a need to create a platform that encourages more meaningful interaction—specifically one that promotes reading and exploration of literature in a visually engaging way.

### Our Solution: A Scrollable Literature Feed

We propose building a book app that mirrors the functionality and interface of Instagram, but instead of endless selfies and memes, users will scroll through short literary pieces—poems, quotes, excerpts from books, and short stories. Each post will be visually appealing, drawing users into reading, reflecting, and perhaps even saving or sharing pieces that resonate with them.

The goal is to replace unproductive scrolling with inspiring and intellectually enriching content. The app can serve as a digital sanctuary for readers, writers, and literature lovers.

### Implementation Plan

Our current focus is to design a template of how the app would look and function. The prototype will be built using:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling and layout (mimicking a social media feed)

JavaScript for dynamic interaction (scrolling effects, like buttons, and saving posts)

The layout will feature a vertical feed of content cards, user-like profiles (e.g., author bios), and interactive features such as likes or comments.

Eventually, this app could evolve into a community-driven platform where users can upload their own writings or favorite passages.
